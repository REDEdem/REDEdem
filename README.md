My name is Edem, and i'm a software developer/gameplay programmer. I'm from Hungary, but currently living in Warsaw. Currently i'm working at CD Projekt Red as (ofc) a Gameplay Programmer.
I'm currently working on Cyberpunk 2077, but I worked on a lot of games, like Witcher 3, GWENT The Witcher Card game, Thronebreaker, Blood and Wine, and I helped develop Last of Us part II a bit.
